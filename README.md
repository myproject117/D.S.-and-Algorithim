ArrayFun.py
---------
This file explains use of Array in different situation for diffreent problem solving

Heap.py
--------
-> This describe how Heap data-structure is used for arranging elements.
-> Insertion in a heap,deletion from a heap etc.
-> Also explains how it can be used for Sorting elements and can be used in Prority Queue for Dynamic Problem Solving.

Sorting.py
----------
-> Diffreent Sorting related Problems

SortingTech.py
--------------
-> Sorting input elemenys using Diffreent Sorting Technique.
-> Techniques like Insertion sort, Selection sort, Quick sort, Merge sort etc
-> Calculating their  Time and Space complexity for efficiency..
-> Also checing and comparing their performance when Sequence already sorted .
-> Checking how sorting mechanisim preserve the order of repeating element,after sorted..

Fibonacci.py
-------------
-> Multiple way of representing Fibonacci series depending on Time and Space consumption..
-> Fibonacci series using Dynamic Programming, Memoisation and recursion or iteration..

Search.py
----------
-> Searching required element using different techniques.
-> Like Lenear Search,Binary Search, Hashing Mechanisim

Tree.py
-------
-> Tree Data Structure and it's implementation
-> Tree  traversal, using multiple techniques(like Preorder,postorder,Inorder) 
-> Creation Binary Search Tree(BST)
